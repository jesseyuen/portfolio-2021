[Vicky](https://www.vickyteinaki.com/) and I never talked, nor did we ever meet face to face. We messaged back a forth a few times, and sometimes liked and commented on each other’s posts. It’s safe to say we barely knew each other, but I’m feeling the loss after last night, learning that she has passed away.

I’ve always been awestruck by Vicky’s omnipresence in the corner of the internet where digital gov, inclusive design and accessibility communities dwell. Her writing and commentary was beyond informative, always inspiring and consistently bang-on. 

Most recently, these three articles are ones I’ve poured over, returned to often and have shared with colleagues and in communities:

* [A plea for the lost practice of information architecture](https://www.vickyteinaki.com/blog/a-plea-for-the-lost-practice-of-information-architecture)
* [Design and uncertainty](https://www.vickyteinaki.com/blog/design-and-uncertainty/)
* [Responsible Interaction Design](https://www.vickyteinaki.com/blog/responsible-interaction-design)

Her post, [Metaphors we stick by,](https://medium.com/gov-design/metaphors-we-sticker-by-4e4ecdbf8d64) is one I revisit every time I join a team who needs some support in forming a healthy identity and culture (which is pretty much every team I've joined since reading this article way back when) and have used the workshop outlined in that post countless times.

I often read [Vicky’s week notes](https://medium.vickyteinaki.com/list/weeknotes-b51e1736a091), as well as those of former colleagues (who are inspiring in their own right) like [Frankie](https://frankieroberto.github.io/nhsnotes/)[](https://frankieroberto.github.io/nhsnotes/%5D%20and%20%5BBenjy) and [Benjy](https://www.benjystanton.co.uk/blog/). I’ve aspired to adopt this practice and do the same; promote transparency, work in the open, share what I learn, document and reflect on the passing weeks, months and years doing my craft, through regular writing.

Last night, after I heard the news of Vicky passing, and after reading many moving tributes online, I rolled up my sleeves and finished setting up this blog. A side-quest I’ve been putting off for far too long now. I’m still tinkering away but it works well enough to share this post.

I don’t yet know what will come of this blog, nor how often I will post, but I will share what I write as and when I do.

Thank you Vicky, for everything you taught us.
