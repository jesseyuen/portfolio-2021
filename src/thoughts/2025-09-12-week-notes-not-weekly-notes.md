Firstly I want to acknowledge that I have not added a post to this blog since the 7th February. A lot has happened between then and now, including having to reconcile with the fact I am simply not wired to write a week note, every week. My mental health has been patchy, family life has been eventful, work incredibly busy and I've been laying low. If you are waiting for a reply from me, please don't take it personally, I'm just very, very slow at replying right now.

## Sydney

I've recently spent a week in Sydney for our company's annual team get together, Hi-Con. For many of us who are used to crawling into and out of our WFH caves each day, a week of in-person time is a daunting prospect yet ultimately, it was hard to ignore the opportunities it created that I do not have when remote. A pint in the late arvo with a peer, ranting and debating prospective ideas for the product it's just something you can't create over Zoom, nor is that face you pull at a mate when your eyes lock across an open plan office. That being said, each visit confirms that if I end up in a future situation where I need to regularly visit an office, I have definitely messed up.

## Traversing jagged peaks

A highlight of the week in the big smoke was meeting [Joshua Crowley](https://joshuacrowley.com/), an educator and designer who runs [Jagged Peaks.](https://jaggedpeaks.club/) I had asked him to run a three hour workshop for the team on Cursor and prototyping AI-first experiences and Multimodal apps. Like what I imagine is happening in many orgs, Hireup has declared a future filled with AI and as designers riding this wave of whatever it will be eventually called, we recognised our team would find value in:

* establishing a common framework for us to help identify good (and less good) AI experiences
* building a shared language for when we talk about AI and design
* some help with understanding how low the barrier of entry actually is to explore emerging interaction paradigms

Josh brought a refreshing level of honesty, humility and deep curiosity, immediately made us all feel safe and led a workshop which we all loved. It was wild to watch Service Designers who had never opened an IDE in their life prompt-build a multimodal shopping list app from scratch. I can't recommend Josh enough if you suspect your team might need a gentle nudge into a space that seems kind of scary from the outside looking in.

## Mapping

I've spent a bit of time pairing on a hybrid service blueprint/user journey type map thingo with a service designer at work. Making all the lines and boxes line up was a super soothing exercise, and it was a bit of load off to be able to finally visualise the complex thing we were mapping yet I couldn't shake [the words of the esteemed Vicky Houghton-Price](https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/do-you-need-another-map-probably-not-2f8a8a7a9773):

> Mapping slows us down from making things real

I reflect though that in times of uncertainty or ambiguity, sometimes just holding a map makes us feel better, regardless of how often we refer back to it.

## Running ~~for~~ is fun

I've started running again, this time experimenting with the Couch to 5km process. I nearly got to 5km runs during COVID but this time I'm feeling hopeful! As a kid I loved running and wanted to be Robert de Castella when I grew up. At 44 I can still feel that same sense of freedom that I felt then once I settle into a good rhythm on the foot falcon. Will keep you posted on my progress.
