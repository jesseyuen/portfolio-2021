              <strong>Civic minded</strong>
              Iâ€™m interested in designing in the space where technology, inclusivity and community meet and I have strong intentions to only work for organisations who do good, not evil.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>User centered</strong>
              All users have the right to a fair and positive experience when using digital products and services. Good design starts by addressing user needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pragmatic</strong>
              Working iteratively and sensibly within a product team requires a pragmatic approach. I prefer to move a little slower and fix things along the way instead of moving fast and breaking everything.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Team focused</strong>
              Teams that make progress and grow together are better outcomes than individuals making a huge impact whilst leaving the team behind. A good designer brings the team along for the ride.
