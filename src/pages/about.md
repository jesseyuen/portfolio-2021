I have 15 years experience designing and developing digital services and products.

I’ve worked at the tech and UCD consultancy [Made Tech](https://www.madetech.com/), sprawling organisations such as [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk) and the [Department for Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education), world class digital agency [Humaan](http://humaan.com/) and freelanced for lovely little places like [Stuff and Nonsense](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/) and [Studio Papa](https://studiopapa.com.au/).

I’m interested in inclusive design and the space where technology and community meet. I have strong intentions to only work for organisations who do good, not evil.
