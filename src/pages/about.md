I’m an experienced interaction (product + ux + code) designer who’s looking to connect with good people, do great work with them and do my bit to encourage and nurture a positive environment in the team that I join.

I’ve worked for big sprawling organisations like [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk) and the [Department for Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education), a world class agency in one of the most isolated cities on earth called [Humaan](http://humaan.com/) and freelanced for lovely little places like [Stuff and Nonsense](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/) and [Studio Papa](https://studiopapa.com.au/).

Currently I’m leading the design of a digital service to support teachers across the UK as well as facilitating a national community of interaction designers.
