title: Perth Device Lab
blurb: I've wanted to open a device lab ever since reading this blog post from
  Jeremy Keith waaaay back when. It wasn't until years later, with the right
  team and a new office with a spare room that it became a reality. The lab
  represents a space where technology, inclusivity and community intersect and
  it was a real joy to do project work that extended beyond the browser and into
  something tangible.

The Device Lab was my passion project while working for [Humaan](http://humaan.com/ "Visit Humaan") and it was a great experience opening our doors to local developers, startups, students, educators, government agencies, suits, thieves and other curious visitors in my time as coordinator.
