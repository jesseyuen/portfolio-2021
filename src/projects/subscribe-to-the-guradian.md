The intention of this work was to increase the visual maturity of the subscription platform. We revisited the entire journey from customer engagement, to 'storefront', checkout and beyond.

### Where we started

Circles... everywhere. The visual aesthetic of the subscription platform had drifted towards a colourful and playful tone. It had suited The Guardian at an earlier time but there was a desire to move towards a more mature, modular and unified design language across our products.

![Screen shots from the Subscription site featuring lots of colourful circles.](/images/circles-1.png "We were going around in circles when I started The Guardian. There was a lack of consistency across the subscription site and a visual language that was not aligned with how we wanted to present the brand. ")

### Wireframing

Designing at varying levels of fidelity allowed us to quickly explore and communicate ideas within the team and with our stakeholders. Iâ€™ll confess I canâ€™t find many of the wireframes from this project but believe me, there were loads.

### Components, patterns and templates

We had a consistency problem. Each page in the subscription site was unique, we had no shared components, no visual or structural commonality that could both unify the browsing experience or allow the product team to quickly assemble new pages and update existing ones.

We wanted to design a collection of modular components that were flexible enough to accommodate all of our products. The components combined would form patterns that would be the basis of consistent page templates across the site.

### Prototyping in code

Communicating responsive layout behaviour to the development team is a challenge when working with static Figma assets. I prototyped a grid system to help communicate the requirements for our new pages. This particular grid system utilised css `grid` with `flexbox` fallback for older browsers. [Visit the prototype](https://relaxed-gates-aefba9.netlify.app/).

### A modular approach

The modular landing page meant we could show/hide and highlight different products based on region.

I designed a product page template that we could use across our entire product range. The product card itself was versatile and as it was brand new, we had the chance to bake more accessible goodies into it.

Part of The Guardians strategy is emotional engagement with their audience. A section of the subscription site was there purely for good old-fashioned emotional manipulation in an editorial style.

### A new checkout

Coming soon.

### Money talks, and good experience walks

Big enterprise can be a challenging ecosystem to work within. There is an ongoing tension between advocating for the user's experience and satisfying business needs, often feeling like an uphill battle.

Sometimes you lose the battle and things go pear shaped, and you end up with a less than ideal experience on the HOMEPAGE of The Guardian. A pay per click campaign ad pushing site content down and an overlay I designed obscuring the bottom half of the page. It made enough money for the user's experience to be knowingly compromised.

Needless to say it was a low point in my career and I still regret working harder towards a solution. Was this the hill I was prepared to die on at the time? No. If I had the chance again? Perhaps.

### Measuring success

We conducted usability testing on Axure prototypes of the user journey, as well as with assistive technology users (screen readers and magnifiers etc) in the research lab. I [tweeted about](https://twitter.com/jesseyuen/status/1111191991738687488) [some of this](https://twitter.com/jesseyuen/status/1107671336560807936) at the time.

AB tests were also conducted with updated designs against the original controls, with new pages all performing better, though not dramatically and that's ok. There were no critical usability issues that we were trying to fix, more so lots (and lots) of niggling issues to be addressed up and a need to reset the landscape to allow for further iteration.
