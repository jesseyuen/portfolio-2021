The intention of this work was to increase the visual maturity of the subscription platform. We revisited the entire journey from customer engagement, to 'storefront', checkout and beyond.

### Where we started

Circles... everywhere. The visual aesthetic of the subscription platform had had drifted towards a colourful and playful tone. It had suited The Guardian at an earlier time but there was a desire to move towards a more mature, modular and unified design language across our products.

There was a lack of consistency across the subscription site and a visual language that was not aligned with how we wanted to present the brand. ")

### Wire framing

Designing at varying levels of fidelity allowed us to quickly explore and communicate ideas within the team and with our stakeholders. I'll confess I can't find many of the wireframes from this projects but believe we there were loads.

### Component + Component = Pattern 

We had a consistency problem. Each page in the subscription site was unique, we had no shared components, no visual or structural commonality that could both unify the browsing experience or allow the product team to quickly assemble new pages and update existing ones.

We wanted to design a collection of modular components that were flexible enough to accommodate all of our products. The components combined would form patterns that would be the basis of consistent page templates across the site.

### Prototyping in code

Communicating responsive layout behaviour to the development team is a challenge when working with static Figma assets. I prototyped a grid system to help communicate the requirements for our new pages. This particular grid system utilised `grid` with `flexbox` fallback for older browsers.

### Highs and lows

Big enterprise can be a challenging ecosystem to work within. Advocating for the users experience and needs over business needs often feels like an uphill battle. Sometimes you loose the battle and things go pear shaped, like this, a horrible, revenue hungry experience on the HOME PAGE of The Guardian. Needless to say it was one of the lowest points in my career and still regret not fighting harder to stop it happening. \

Was this the hill I was prepared to die on at the time? No. If I had the chance again? Perhaps, yes.
