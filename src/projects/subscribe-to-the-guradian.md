  Mature rebrand
  More accessible
  Templated and modular approach to design

Working across multiple agile teams means I had a lot of projects in play at any one time. Some moved slow, others moved very quickly. Some stopped and never started again. Big enterprise can be a challenging ecosystem to work within.

### Where we started

Circles... everywhere. The visual aesthetic of the subscription site had had drifted towards a colourful and playful tone. It had suited The Guardian at an earlier time but there was a desire to move towards a more mature, modular and unified design language.

There was a lack of consistency across the subscription site and a visual language that was not align with how we wanted to present the brand. ")

### Highs and lows

Big enterprise can be a challenging ecosystem to work within. Advocating for the users experience and needs over business needs often feels like an uphill battle. Sometimes you loose the battle and things go pear shaped, like this, a horrible, revenue hungry experience on the HOME PAGE of The Guardian. Needless to say it was one of the lowest points in my career and still regret not fighting harder to stop it happening. \

Was this the hill I was prepared to die on at the time? No. If I had the chance again? Perhaps, yes.
