  What would I have done differently?

Im an experinced (front of the) front end developer who enjoys bridging the gap between design and development and ensuring the products I help build are semantic, accessible and robust.

### [Sodashi](https://www.sodashi.co.uk/)

Built in my time at Humaan, Sodashi is a elegant e-comerce site with subtle and buttery animation.

### Tight budgets and scaling design with modular components

How do you design a site for a multi-faceted organisation with a budget that allowed for only 3 page templates? I proposed a collection of modular components that the client could use to *curate* their own layouts using a site building interface in the CMS.

I designed complementary components as well as the logic of how interface items should relate to each other when added to a page. This system facilitated the clients page layout needs on a page per page basis.
