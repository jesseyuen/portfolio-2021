title: "(Front of the) front end development "
blurb: I enjoy bridging the gap between design and development and ensuring the
  products I help build are semantic, accessible and robust yet also have
  beautiful interactive experiences. Most of these were built while I was
  working at Humaan.

## Mideast Tunes Radio

Mideast Tunes Radio is a hub for podcasts created by Mideast Tunes, a platform to discover underground musicians in the Middle East and North Africa. Being bi-lingual (Arabic and English) meant I needed to accommodate for both left-to-right and right-to-left layouts.
