title: "(Front of the) front end development "
blurb: As a (front of the) front end developer I enjoy bridging the gap between
  design and development and ensuring the products I help build are semantic,
  accessible and robust yet also have beautiful interactive experiences. Most of
  these were built while I was working at Humaan.

Mideast Tunes Radio is a hub for podcasts created by Mideast Tunes, a platform to discover underground musicians in the Middle East and North Africa. Being bi-lingual (Arabic and English) meant I needed to accommodate for both left-to-right and right-to-left layouts.
