I'm an experinced (front of the) front end developer who enjoys bridging the gap between design and development and ensuring the products I help build are semantic, accessible and robust. Most of these were built while I was working at Humaan.

### Mideast Tunes Radio

Mideast Tunes Radio is a hub for podcasts created by Mideast Tunes, a platform to discover underground musicians in the Middle East and North Africa. Being bi-lingual (Arabic and English) meant I needed to accomadate for both left-to-right and right-to-left layouts.
