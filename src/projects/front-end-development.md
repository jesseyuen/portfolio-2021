  What would I have done differently?

Im an experinced (front of the) front end developer who enjoys bridging the gap between design and development and ensuring the products I help build are semantic, accessible and robust.

### Design principles

The client was very clear with their brief. The site must appeal to a socially and geographically diverse audience, it must be accessible and also respectful of local indigenous culture. These key points outlined our design principles throughout the project.

### Accessible and inclusive design

• acessability benefits
• culteral benefits

### Tight budgets and scaling design with modular components

How do you design a site for a multi-faceted organisation with a budget that allowed for only 3 page templates? I proposed a collection of modular components that the client could use to *curate* their own layouts using a site building interface in the CMS.

I designed complementary components as well as the logic of how interface items should relate to each other when added to a page. This system facilitated the clients page layout needs on a page per page basis.
