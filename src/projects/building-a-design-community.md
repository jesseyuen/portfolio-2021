I was one of the original permanent designers at the DfE. A community of designers was missing and I wanted to do something about it. 

What does community mean to me? Time for reflection, what do I want in a community?

### Starting small

How does a community start? Humble and awkward beginnings.

### Beginning to grow

Expanding the scope and gong national. How to get people interested? How to keep people engaged? How to build trust and a create space for people to feel safe.

## Community events

Running regular workshops to engage the community.

### Workshop: What do you want to get out of the community?

An ongoing conversation to ensure the needs of the community are being met...

### Workshop:  Identifying common user interface elements

Do we need a design system? A pattern library? A frequently asked question in big orgs. An exercise to explore needs across the DfE services.

### Show the thing

Teams present what they are up to, tell the stories of their service. Hearing colleagues talk about challenges, opportunities and outcomes is beneficial to all. Breaks down the silos, share knowledge, designers get to receive feedback, designers get comfortable with sharing work.

## Connecting others

Community growth can happen at various layers within the design space. 

Large public ceremonies like meet ups are good for...

People connecting in smaller groups in an intimate settings is good for and allows...

Identifying good matches and connecting them. Pairing senior and junior designers, finding people mentors, creating mentoring opportunities for others.

## Why do I do it?

I'm driven by a sense of collectiveness. I like the feeling of being part of something... I want that opportunity to be available for others if they feel the same way...
