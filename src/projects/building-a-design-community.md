I'm driving by a sense of collectiveness. I like the feeling of being part of something. I was one of the original permanent designers at the DfE. When I started, there was no design community.

**Starting small**

How does a community start? Humble and awkward beginnings

**Beginning to grow**

Expanding the scope and gong national. How to get people interested? How to keep people engaged? How to build trust and a create space for people to feel safe.

### Workshop formats

Running regular workshops to engage the community.

**What do you want to get out of the community?** 

An ongoing conversation to ensure the needs of the community are being met...

**Identifying common user interface elements**

**Show the thing**

Teams present what they are up to, tell the stories of their service. Hearing colleagues talk about challenges, opportunities and outcomes is beneficial to all. Breaks down the silos, shares the knowledge, designers get to receive feedback.

### Connecting others

Community growth can happen at various layers within the design space. 

Large public ceremonies like meet ups are good for...

Smaller groups connecting in more intimate settings allow...

Identifying good matches and connecting them. Pairing senior and junior designers, creating mentoring opportunities,
