outro: This design project was [completed while](google.com) I freelanced
  remotely for Studio Papa, a digital agency based in Western Australia. The
  budget was (very) tight yet we wanted to deliver something that would be
  flexible enough to allow our client to scale their online presence and
  offerings.

Intro about the mission, BAT teams etc

### User centred design

Gov focus is very strong. Cross discipline teams, working with UR and CD, sharing UX.

### Heading

Working closely with a creative director I designed and then developed a libray of components and patterns that is intended for an inhouse team of software engineers. We redesigned their entire collection of interface components as well as developed infrastructure and logic around how they could create new, responsive and accessible layouts.

We prioritised accessibility and semantic meaning when developing the system and relied heavily on modern techniques like CSS Grid for layout and CSS Custom Properties for presentation.
