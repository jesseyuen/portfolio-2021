Register Trainee Teachers does what is says on the tin, register trainees with the Department for Education and record the outcome of their training. Teachers across England will have their progress tracked using this service. 

### Where we started

We were replacing a legacy product which was relatively new but not at all designed or developed with users in mind. The existing product was inaccessible, and users complained of usability issues.

![The original dashboard](/images/dashboard-example.png "The dashboard or the original product we redesigned. Users struggled with the tasks they needed to complete..")

The product is essential a CRM for trainee teachers, with user interaction largely focused on inputting data in forms. The original product had a number of issues:

* users were constantly being timed out
* a users progress wasn't being saved
* iconography, language and error messaging was confusing 
* forms were embedded within modals that presented significant accessibility challenges

![An example of the original forms.](/images/exit-information.png "There was no way to know how 'complete' a registration was nor what was left to complete.")

### Co-design for the win 

This project had two senior designers. A bit of a treat to be honest, with ongoing opportunity for peer feedback and someone always there to bounce ideas off who knew the project intimately. Seeking and giving feedback are both challenging things to do well, yet get easier with practice and allow for better design. 

Designing collaboratively can be a rewarding experience but requires the people involved to be low on ego, strong in communication and also vulnerable and open to feedback.

### User centred design

I've not experienced user centered design done as well as it is within government design teams. UCD is respected by stakeholders and forms the core principles of how products are designed. There are no UX designers on the team and its refreshing! Instead we recognise that user experience is everybody's responsibility. 

The core UCD team is made up of user researchers, content and interaction designers with front end developers often helping to complete the group responsible for *UX,* and by sharing it we remove unintentional bias and bring our own individual experiences and knowledge to the product.

### Designing in flows

Some digital services are more transactional, with a relatively liner user journey. This service was far more complicated, where once created, a trainee record may exist in the system fir a number of years, with our users returning at various points though-out a trainee teachers progress to update data and complete tasks.

![A user flow diagram](/images/flows.jpeg  "User flows were created to map complex processes and communicate business rules to the team before way before any visual design was done.")

### Designing in code

We designed this service exclusively in code, building a functional prototype using the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs), and using components from the [GOV.UK design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/). 

A browser based prototype that looks, feels and most importantly works like the real thing allowed us to conduct detailed usability testing as well as provided a valuable resource for the development team to follow when moving our design into production.
