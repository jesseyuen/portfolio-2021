Register Trainee Teachers does what is says on the tin, register trainees with the Department for Education and record the outcome of their training. Teachers across England will have their progress tracked using this service. 

### Where we started

We were replacing a legacy product which was relatively new but not at all designed or developed with users in mind. The existing product was inaccessible, and users complained of usability issues.

![The original dashboard](/images/dashboard-example.png "The dashboard or the original product we redesigned. Users struggled with the tasks they needed to complete..")

The product is essential a CRM for trainee teachers, with user interaction largely focused on inputting data in forms. The original product had a number of issues:

* users were constantly being timed out
* a users progress wasn't being saved
* iconography, language and error messaging was confusing 
* forms were embedded within modals that presented significant accessibility challenges

### Co-designing?

This project had two senior designers. A great opportunity, what are the challanges?

### Defining MVP

### User centred design

Gov focus is very strong. Cross discipline teams, working with UR and CD, sharing UX.
