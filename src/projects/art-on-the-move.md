blurb: This design project was completed while I freelanced remotely for Studio
  Papa, a digital agency based in Western Australia. The budget was (very) tight
  yet we wanted to deliver something that would be flexible enough to allow our
  client to scale their online presence and offerings.

## Design principles

The client was very clear with their brief. The site must appeal to a socially and geographically diverse audience, it must be accessible and also respectful of local indigenous culture. These key points outlined our design principles throughout the project.

## Tight budgets and scaling design with modular components

How do you design a site for a multi-faceted organisation with a budget that allowed for only 3 page templates? I proposed a collection of modular components that the client could use to *curate* their own layouts using a site building interface in the CMS.

I designed complementary components as well as the logic of how interface items should relate to each other when added to a page. This system facilitated the clients page layout needs on a page per page basis.
