blurb: Before you go any further I want to warn you that I'm designing and building this site in the open.<br><br>Why? Because I want to to share it with you, and if I wait until I'm finished you'll never see it! In the spirit of iterative design, tread wearily my friend and don't mind the typos, bugs and less polished bits.

## A little about me

I'm an experienced interaction (product + ux + code) designer who's looking to connect with good people, do great work with them and do my bit to encourage and nurture a positive environment in the team that I join.

I've worked for big sprawling organisations like [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk) and the [Department for Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education), world class agency [Humaan](http://humaan.com/) and freelanced for lovely little places like [Stuff and Nonsesne](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/) and [Studio Papa](https://studiopapa.com.au/).

Currently I'm leading the design of a digital service to support teachers across the UK as well as facilitating a national community of interaction designers.

## Civic minded

Iâ€™m interested in designing in the space where technology, inclusivity and community meet and I have strong intentions to only work for organisations who do good, not evil. 

## User centered

I believe all users have the right to a fair and positive experience using the products I help design and build. Good design starts by addressing user needs.

## Pragmatic

Working iteratively and senseibly within a product team requires pragmatism. I prefer to move a little slower and fix things along the way instead of move fast and break all the things.

## Team focused

I prioritise team health and part of this is ensuring others around me feel empowered and involved. Teams that make progress and grow together is a better outcome than individuals making huge impact whilst leaving the team behind. A good designer brings the team along for the ride.
