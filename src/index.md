## A little about me

I'm an experienced interaction designer and developer who's looking to connect with good people, do great work with them and do my bit to encourage and nurture a positive environment in the team that I join.

I've worked at big sprawling organisations like [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk) and the [Department for Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education), a world class agency called [Humaan](http://humaan.com/) and freelanced for lovely little places like [Stuff and Nonsesne](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/) and [Studio Papa](https://studiopapa.com.au/).

Currently I'm leading the design of a digital service to support teachers across the UK as well as facilitating a national community of interaction designers.

## Civic minded

I’m interested in designing in the space where technology, inclusivity and community meet and I have strong intentions to only work for organisations who do good, not evil. 

## User centered

I’m an accessibility judge in the Australian Web Awards who believes everyone has the right to a fair and positive experience using products I design and build.

## Pragmatic

Working iteratively and and senseibly within a product team requires pragmatism. I don't believe in moving fast and breaking things and instead prefer to move as fast as I can while fixing things.
