Why? Because I want to to share it with you, and if I wait until I'm finished you'll never see it! 

I'm in the process of adding and updating work and messing about. Yesterday this site was black, now it's green. Tomorrow I might add some squiggles here and there.

In the spirit of iterative design, tread warily my friend and don't mind the typos, bugs, less polished bits and accessibility issues.

In the meantime, learn more [about me](about) or view [selected projects](projects).
